memory_prune.py

This module is responsible for the long-term maintenance of the AGI's memory.
It periodically reviews stored memories to identify candidates for pruning
(deletion) and reinforcement.

- Pruning: Memories with low importance and recall counts are re-submitted to
  the memory debate loop. If the debate consensus is 'REJECT', the memory is
  deleted. This prevents the accumulation of useless information.
- Reinforcement: Memories with very high recall counts have their importance
  scores adjusted and their recall counts reset, preventing them from being
  pruned while acknowledging their recurring relevance.
