memoryloop.py

Implements the debate-based memory validation and filtering system. This is a
critical component for ensuring the AGI only learns from high-quality,
verified information.

The process involves two LLM "judges" that debate the validity and usefulness
of a "candidate memory." Only memories that achieve a consensus of "ACCEPT"
are passed on to be permanently stored.
