Verify Project Location:\n   - Ensure that the project files are present in ~/Home/VOIDE.\n   - If the directory is incorrect, update the path to the correct project location.\n\n2. Populate the Directory:\n   - If the project is new, add source code, configuration files, and tests to ~/Home/VOIDE before running inspections.\n\n3. Re-run Inspection:\n   - Once files are present, repeat the inspection process to identify and fix errors.\n\n4. Tool Usage Correction:\n   - When using file system tools, ensure correct argument names (e.g., fs_glob with pattern instead of fs_list with path).\n\nNext Steps:\n\n- Place your project files in ~/Home/VOIDE or specify the correct path.\n- Re-initiate the inspection process to proceed with error detection and resolution.\n\nNo further action can be taken until project files are available in the specified directory."}
