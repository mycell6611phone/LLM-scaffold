Final Deliverable: Project Inspection and Error Resolution Summary

Summary of Actions:

- Navigated to ~/Home/VOIDE.
- Attempted to list files and directories to assess project structure.
- Attempted static code analysis, unit test execution, and code review.

Findings:

- No files or directories were found in ~/Home/VOIDE.
- Static analysis, unit testing, and code review could not proceed due to the absence of project files.
- No changes were made, and nothing was committed to version control.

Actionable Recommendations:

1. Verify Project Location:
   - Ensure that the project files are present in ~/Home/VOIDE.
   - If the directory is incorrect, update the path to the correct project location.

2. Populate the Directory:
   - If the project is new, add source code, configuration files, and tests to ~/Home/VOIDE before running inspections.

3. Re-run Inspection:
   - Once files are present, repeat the inspection process to identify and fix errors.

4. Tool Usage Correction:
   - When using file system tools, ensure correct argument names (e.g., fs_glob with pattern instead of fs_list with path).

Next Steps:

- Place your project files in ~/Home/VOIDE or specify the correct path.
- Re-initiate the inspection process to proceed with error detection and resolution.

No further action can be taken until project files are available in the specified directory.
